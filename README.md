## Flow API Client

Currently, flow-api-client is released independently and manually. You can do so with:

```bash
git tag flow-api-client/vX.X.X
git push origin flow-api-client/vX.X.X
```

and make use of it in another project with

```bash
go get github.com/PeerDB-io/peerdb/flow-api-client@vX.X.X
```
